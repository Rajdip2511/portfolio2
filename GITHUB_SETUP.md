# GitHub Authentication Setup 🔐

## Your code is ready to push! Here's what we've done:

✅ **Git repository initialized**
✅ **All files committed** (80 files, 15,397 insertions)
✅ **Remote origin added**: https://github.com/Rajdip2511/portfolio2.git
✅ **Branch renamed to main**

## 🚫 Authentication Issue

We need to authenticate with GitHub to push the code. Here are your options:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. **Create a Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select scopes: `repo` (full access)
   - Copy the token

2. **Push with token:**
   ```bash
   git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/Rajdip2511/portfolio2.git main
   ```

### Option 2: GitHub CLI (Alternative)

1. **Open a new terminal window** (GitHub CLI was just installed)
2. **Authenticate:**
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
3. **Push:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 3: SSH Key (Most Secure)

1. **Generate SSH key:**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "rajdipcollege@gmail.com"
   ```
2. **Add to GitHub:** https://github.com/settings/keys
3. **Change remote to SSH:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Rajdip2511/portfolio2.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## 🎯 Once pushed, you can:

1. **Deploy to Vercel** by connecting the GitHub repo
2. **Auto-deploy** on every push
3. **Use custom domain** if desired

Your portfolio is 100% ready for production! 🚀
